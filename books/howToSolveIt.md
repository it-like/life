#### Part I
Focus on how the student should rigorously fall into specific categories of thinking when solving a problem; *what data is available*, and most importantly *What is the unknown*? 
To realise what is not known is an excellent strategy to crack the problem. It is a mental skill which can be trained with an example of swimming made in the book. To be a good swimmer, one must study and practice regularly. In the same spirit, to be a good problem solver, one must study and practice problems regularly.
A large emphasis is placed on the relation of a student and a teacher, that being that the teacher must balance on the thin line of thought-provocation, where on one side the student might not make the connection to the problem naturally, or feel defeated by having taken the problem in a very different category (a really good example is shown in the book, where one follows a classroom and a teacher searching for the diagonal length of a rectangular cuboid, teasing the idea of Pythagoras, but never truly mentioning it before the student makes the connection).
Makes me think there is a large emphasis on the understanding of the basics, especially in trigonometries.



#### Part II
Large emphasis is placed on digging around for more information. Sure you are stuck, but how well do you know the problem? Are you aware of what the unknown is for the problem? Can you recall the full problem by memory, do you see all the data, is the solution water-proof? Polya ends the part with:
	*If you get in the habit of surveying and scrutinising your solutions in this way, you will acquire some knowledge well ordered and ready to use, and you will develop your ability to solve problems.* p.36


#### Part III
Reflects about the power of analogy, the idea of a easier problem satisfying the auxiliary harder problem. If you do not understand the problem, solve a simpler "version" of it, and work up your understanding.
	*Simplex sigillum veri - simplicity is the seal of truth* p.45 
If you are not sure in your answer, test it with some basic mental gymnastics, does your answer grow if a depending variable is affected in the correct way? One example is made of a pyramid, with some basic tests with length 0, symmetries etc.
Having seen problems in the past is monumental for solving new ones. Generalisation and analogy are very strong tools in mathematics.
Briefly regards Euclid's inductive problem solving style. Googled a bit regarding Euclid's *Elements*, seems fascinating, especially [this website](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/). He seemed to focus more on the idea of rigorous mental proof rather than pure mathematical proof, for example how he derives [proposition 13 in book 1](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/propI13.html). 
There is a statement made on the *inventors paradox*, that solving a more general/easier problem can cover the problem in question.
The key takeaway so far in the chapter is that a problem is hard to solve since there does not exist a clear path to the answer. Only by illuminating our data with ideas can we find the path to the answer, bridging the unknown and known.

Given the data, what can you tell about the unknown? Is there some way to make the field of unknown smaller? One example is made where a problem is given, and the datum in the question narrows the range of the unknown.

There are simple mental checks to be done when discussing if a problem is logically true as to implement some corner cases, such as when a length becomes 0, does the given datum still hold? 
A proof can not hold in absurdity, hence ***Reductio ad Absurdum***.
Examples shown in the book as where the natural set not being able to sum to 100 and infinite primes motivated by infinite integers.

Going over the given problem, datum can be extracted to narrow the range of the possible answer.

One thing I had forgotten was ***Test of dimensionality***. One example is that if there is trouble remembering which equation corresponds to the volume of a sphere, \[\frac{4\pi r^3}{3}\] or \[4\pi r^2\], a quick test of dimensionality will show the correct equation.

Working backwards is a powerful tool. If there are multiple paths, but only one lead to the solution, the correct path is the one which is walked from the beginning.
